# RTGCompCognition

This repo distils the evolution of my thought processes during my PhD at the University of Osnabrueck. It entails a journey from signal theory (in biology), to the etymology of language, to signal processing (audio, images, and videos) to SoTA Machine Learning. This is a work-in-progress, so bear with me ;).

## Installation

If the universe brought you here, I am assuming you are into the number-crunching game viz-a-viz Machine Learning whether in research or practice. So, here are a few simple steps to run the codes in this repo.
1. Get Conda from [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Pay close attention to your platform!

2. Get a python environment from your terminal (Conda prompt for Windows users): I am lazy so I use the following nifty keystrokes!

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.x
```

where myenv (you can be creative and wild with your naming) is the name of your environment and x is the minor version of your liking.

3. Activate your new virtual environment

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

To deactivate, use the following command:

```bash
 conda deactivate
```

4. Install the dependencies using the following command.

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

5. Start Jupyter Lab or Notebook. The choice is definitely yours.
```bash
jupyter lab
```

This is all there is.
